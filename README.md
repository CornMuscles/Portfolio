 Portfolio of learning objects
This is a portfolio of various learning objects Justin "Corn Muscles" Beaudry has created and is showing off to the world. This space will eventually include themes, templates, tutorials, and full elearning objects (likely in Adobe Captivate).

Everything here is free to use, download, and enjoy, via the GNU gpl.

Thanks,
Justin
